A concise, orderly list is of particular importance in acute care situations. Due to the large variety of symptoms, the situation concerns not only a CPR setting, but also cases in which the patient’s condition rapidly worsens as a result of existing symptoms.\r\nA healthcare provider consulting this information can discuss these existing treatment instructions with the patient, the patient’s family or the patient’s authorized representative and possibly include the instructions in their policy.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-treatmentdirective-v3.1-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/TreatmentDirective-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM
