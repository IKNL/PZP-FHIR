Limitations in this ability indicate a reduced ability to cope for oneself.\r\nThis activity and activities such as those including cooking, using the telephone and shopping are also known as instrumentel activities of daily living (IADL). These tasks support an independent life style. Many people can still live independently even though they need help with one or two of these IADLâ€™s.","purpose":"# Purpose of HCIM\r\nTo promote safe and proper use of medication, it is important in patient care to know whether the patient is capable of using the medication independently, or if the patient needs help doing so. \r\n\r\n# Purpose of this profile\r\nThis profile is part of a group of statements regarding the patients ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Each statement applies to the current situation and is modeled as an observation regarding one aspect of these abilities.\r\nAlthough the FHIR ClinicalImpression resource is a better fit than the Observation resource for these kinds of records, ClinicalImpression is still highly experimental at the time of writing and doesn't map very well to the HCIM. Therefore, the more mature Observation resource is chosen.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytomanagemedication-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/AbilityToManageMedication-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM AbilityToManageMedication-v1.0(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Observation","baseDefinition":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-observation","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Observation","path":"Observation","alias":["AbilityToManageMedication"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytomanagemedication-v1.0-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:4.35.1","comment":"AbilityToManageMedication"}]},{"id":"Observation.extension","path":"Observation.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Observation.extension:requiredAssistance","path":"Observation.extension","sliceName":"requiredAssistance","max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/observation-zibNursingInterventionReference"}]},{"id":"Observation.extension:requiredAssistance.valueReference:valueReference","path":"Observation.extension.valueReference","sliceName":"valueReference","short":"RequiredAssistance","definition":"The nursing support a patient needs to manage one's own medication.","alias":["HulpBijToediening"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytomanagemedication-v1.0-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:4.35.3","comment":"RequiredAssistance"}]},{"id":"Observation.code.coding","path":"Observation.code.coding","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"code"}],"rules":"open"},"min":1},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToManageMedication","path":"Observation.code.coding","sliceName":"AbilityToManageMedication","min":1,"max":"1"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToManageMedication.system","path":"Observation.code.coding.system","min":1,"fixedUri":"http://snomed.info/sct"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToManageMedication.code","path":"Observation.code.coding.code","min":1,"fixedCode":"285033005"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToManageMedication.display","extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-translatable","valueBoolean":true}],"path":"Observation.code.coding.display","defaultValueString":"Ability to manage medication"},{"id":"Observation.value[x]:valueCodeableConcept","path":"Observation.valueCodeableConcept","sliceName":"valueCodeableConcept","short":"IndependentMedicationUse","definition":"The degree of ability of  the patient to independently manage their own medication.","alias":["ZelfstandigMedicatiegebruik"],"min":1,"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"ZelfstandigMedicatiegebruikCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.4.35.1--20171231000000"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytomanagemedication-v1.0-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:4.35.2","comment":"ZelfstandigMedicatiegebruik"}]}]}}
