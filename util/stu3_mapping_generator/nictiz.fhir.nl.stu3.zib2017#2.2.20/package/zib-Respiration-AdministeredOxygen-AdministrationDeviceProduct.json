Observations of spontaneous breathing, usually registered as part of the observation of vital functions.","purpose":"# Purpose of HCIM\r\nObserving a person’s spontaneous breathing, including recording breathing frequency, depth and rhythm, is done to gain an indication of the health condition of the patient’s pulmonary system.\r\n\r\n# Purpose of this profile\r\nThis profile can be used to register an external device for oxygen administration. It can be bound to the zib-Respiration profile (Observation) using the zib-Respiration-AdministeredOxygen-AdministationDevice profile (DeviceUseStatement).","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-respiration-v3.1-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Respiration-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM Respiration-v3.1(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Device","baseDefinition":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-MedicalDeviceProduct","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Device.type","path":"Device.type","binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"ToedieningHulpmiddelCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.12.5.4--20171231000000","display":"ProductTypeCodelijst"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-respiration-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:10.1.3","comment":"ProductType"}]}]}}
