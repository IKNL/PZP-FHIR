This is in regard to any current or future problems the patient encounters or could encounter when living with the disease and the patient’s (future) constraints. \r\nThere are many reasons to ask about the patient’s living situation. The living situation can be relevant in the patient’s wish to live in their own home independently in the event of disease and/or disability (WMO, 2011; CIZ, 2011). Furthermore, the living situation is important in evaluating the risks of falling, particularly among people living alone (CMO, guidelines for fall prevention, 2004).","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-v3.1-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/LivingSituation-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM LivingSituation-v3.1(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-basicelements-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-3.0-2016EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/LivingSituation-v3.0(2016EN)","name":"HCIM LivingSituation-v3.0(2016EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-v1.2-2015EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/LivingSituation-v1.2(2015EN)","name":"HCIM LivingSituation-v1.2(2015EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Observation","baseDefinition":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-observation","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Observation","path":"Observation","short":"LivingSituation","alias":["Woonsituatie"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-v1.2-2015EN","map":"NL-CM:7.8.1","comment":"LivingSituation"},{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-3.0-2016EN","map":"NL-CM:7.8.1","comment":"LivingSituation"},{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:7.8.1","comment":"LivingSituation"}]},{"id":"Observation.code.coding","path":"Observation.code.coding","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"system"},{"type":"value","path":"code"}],"rules":"open"},"min":1},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:livingSituationCode","path":"Observation.code.coding","sliceName":"livingSituationCode","min":1,"max":"1"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:livingSituationCode.system","path":"Observation.code.coding.system","min":1,"fixedUri":"http://snomed.info/sct"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:livingSituationCode.code","path":"Observation.code.coding.code","min":1,"fixedCode":"365508006"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:livingSituationCode.display","extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-translatable","valueBoolean":true}],"path":"Observation.code.coding.display","defaultValueString":"Finding of residence and accommodation circumstances (finding)"},{"id":"Observation.value[x]:valueCodeableConcept","path":"Observation.valueCodeableConcept","sliceName":"valueCodeableConcept","short":"TypeOfHome","definition":"Type of home the patient lives in.","alias":["WoningType"],"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"example":[{"label":"Example of TypeofHome","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"system":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.4.13.1","code":"FLATW","display":"Appartement of flatwoning"}]}}],"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"Type of home the patient lives in.","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.7.8.1--20171231000000","display":"WoningTypeCodelijst"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-v1.2-2015EN","map":"NL-CM:7.8.3","comment":"TypeOfHome"},{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-3.0-2016EN","map":"NL-CM:7.8.3","comment":"TypeOfHome"},{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:7.8.3","comment":"HouseType"}]},{"id":"Observation.comment","path":"Observation.comment","short":"Comment","definition":"Comments in free text on problems or details of the patient’s living situation that may be relevant.","alias":["Toelichting"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-v1.2-2015EN","map":"NL-CM:7.8.2","comment":"Explanation"},{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-3.0-2016EN","map":"NL-CM:7.8.2","comment":"Explanation"},{"identity":"hcim-livingsituation-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:7.8.2","comment":"Comment"}]}]}}
