This is a part of self-care. Limitations in this ability indicate a reduced ability to cope for oneself. Washing hair does not fall into this category; it falls under the ability to wash oneself.\r\nThis activity and activities such as those including eating, getting dressed and bathing are also known as activities of daily living (ADL). These are the activities people go through in daily life. The extent to which a person is able to do all these activities by themselves is a measure for their total ability to do things independently.","purpose":"# Purpose of HCIM\r\nInformation on a patient’s ability to perform activities of personal grooming is important in determining the nature and intensity of the care the patient needs. In a transfer situation, it offers the receiving organization the ability to anticipate the intensity of the care to be given to the patient, enabling continuity in healthcare for the patient.\r\nIf policy has been implemented to improve a patient’s ability to do things independently, the entered extent of independence helps to determine the efficiency of the treatment. \r\n\r\n# Purpose of this profile\r\nThis profile is part of a group of statements regarding the patients ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Each statement applies to the current situation and is modeled as an observation regarding one aspect of these abilities.\r\nAlthough the FHIR ClinicalImpression resource is a better fit than the Observation resource for these kinds of records, ClinicalImpression is still highly experimental at the time of writing and doesn't map very well to the HCIM. Therefore, the more mature Observation resource is chosen.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytogroome-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/AbilityToGroome-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM AbilityToGroome-v1.0(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Observation","baseDefinition":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-observation","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Observation","path":"Observation","alias":["VermogenTotUiterlijkeVerzorging"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytogroome-v1.0-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:4.33.1","comment":"AbilityToGroome"}]},{"id":"Observation.code.coding","path":"Observation.code.coding","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"code"}],"rules":"open"},"min":1},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToGroome","path":"Observation.code.coding","sliceName":"AbilityToGroome","min":1,"max":"1"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToGroome.system","path":"Observation.code.coding.system","min":1,"fixedUri":"http://snomed.info/sct"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToGroome.code","path":"Observation.code.coding.code","min":1,"fixedCode":"704434006"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToGroome.display","extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-translatable","valueBoolean":true}],"path":"Observation.code.coding.display","defaultValueString":"Ability to perform personal grooming activity"},{"id":"Observation.value[x]:valueCodeableConcept","path":"Observation.valueCodeableConcept","sliceName":"valueCodeableConcept","short":"Grooming","definition":"Personal grooming includes tending to hair and facial hair, such as combing it, or shaving and/or trimming facial hair; skincare, e.g. using make-up; nailcare.","alias":["UiterlijkeVerzorging"],"min":1,"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"UiterlijkeVerzorgingCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.4.33.1--20171231000000"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytogroome-v1.0-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:4.33.2","comment":"Grooming"}]}]}}
