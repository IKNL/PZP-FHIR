Observations of spontaneous breathing, usually registered as part of the observation of vital functions.","purpose":"# Purpose of HCIM\r\nObserving a person’s spontaneous breathing, including recording breathing frequency, depth and rhythm, is done to gain an indication of the health condition of the patient’s pulmonary system.\r\n\r\n# Purpose of this profile\r\nThis profile can be used to register the use of an external device for oxygen administration.
