A burn wound is a wound caused by skin being exposed to heat for a certain time above a certain critical temperature. Heat above this critical temperature (+/- 40°C) will cause damage to the skin. There are different types of burn wounds, which are categorized according to the depth of the burn wound.  \r\nThe depth of the burn wound depends on:  \r\n-  the temperature of the impacting heat;\r\n-  the duration of the impact of heat on the skin;\r\n-  the source of the burn (e.g. fire, fluid).","purpose":"The description of the burn wound is of importance for starting or continuing the best possible wound treatment and to be able to properly monitor the wound healing process.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Burnwound-v3.2(2017EN)","name":"HCIM BurnWound-v3.2(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-basicelements-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Condition","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Condition","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Condition","path":"Condition","short":"BurnWound","alias":["Brandwond"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.1","comment":"BurnWound"}]},{"id":"Condition.extension","path":"Condition.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Condition.extension:dateOfLastDressingChange","path":"Condition.extension","sliceName":"dateOfLastDressingChange","definition":"Date on which the dressing was last changed.","max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/condition-dateOfLastDressingChange"}]},{"id":"Condition.extension:dateOfLastDressingChange.valueDateTime:valueDateTime","path":"Condition.extension.valueDateTime","sliceName":"valueDateTime","short":"DateOfLastDressingChange","definition":"Date on which the dressing was last changed.","alias":["DatumLaatsteVerbandwissel"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.8","comment":"DateOfLastDressingChange"}]},{"id":"Condition.extension:extent","path":"Condition.extension","sliceName":"extent","max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-BurnWound-Extent"}]},{"id":"Condition.extension:extent.valueQuantity:valueQuantity","path":"Condition.extension.valueQuantity","sliceName":"valueQuantity","short":"extent","definition":"The extent of a burn wound is indicated in a percentage of the ‘Total Body Surface Area’ (TBSA). For adults, the TBSA can be calculated on the basis of the ‘rule of nines’, in which body parts are expressed in the percentage 9 and multiples of 9. This ‘rule of nines’ cannot be used for children because a child’s body proportions are different from those of an adult. For children, separate tables were developed per age group to determine the extent of burn wounds. Another option is measuring the extent using the patient’s hand surface area. The surface area of a patient’s hand (including the fingers) equals approximately 1% of their total body surface area.","alias":["Uitgebreidheid"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.7","comment":"Extent"}]},{"id":"Condition.code","path":"Condition.code","short":"BurnWound","definition":"Indication of the kind of the burn wound, differentiated into the cause of the injury.","alias":["Brandwond"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.1","comment":"BurnWound"}]},{"id":"Condition.code.extension","path":"Condition.code.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Condition.code.extension:burnType","path":"Condition.code.extension","sliceName":"burnType","max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-BurnWound-BurnWoundType"}]},{"id":"Condition.code.extension:burnType.valueCodeableConcept:valueCodeableConcept","path":"Condition.code.extension.valueCodeableConcept","sliceName":"valueCodeableConcept","short":"BurnType","definition":"Indication of the kind of the burn wound, differentiated into the cause of the injury.","alias":["BrandwondSoort"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.9","comment":"BurnType"}]},{"id":"Condition.code.coding","path":"Condition.code.coding","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"code"}],"rules":"open"},"min":1},{"id":"Condition.code.coding:BurnWoundCode","path":"Condition.code.coding","sliceName":"BurnWoundCode","min":1,"max":"1"},{"id":"Condition.code.coding:BurnWoundCode.system","path":"Condition.code.coding.system","min":1,"fixedUri":"http://snomed.info/sct"},{"id":"Condition.code.coding:BurnWoundCode.code","path":"Condition.code.coding.code","min":1,"fixedCode":"125666000"},{"id":"Condition.code.coding:BurnWoundCode.display","path":"Condition.code.coding.display","defaultValueString":"Brandwond"},{"id":"Condition.bodySite","path":"Condition.bodySite","short":"AnatomicalLocation","definition":"The location of the burn wound on the body.","alias":["AnatomischeLocatie"],"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"BrandwondAnatomischeLocatieCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.19.4.2--20171231000000","display":"ProbleemAnatomischeLocatieCodelijst"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.4","comment":"AnatomicalLocation"}]},{"id":"Condition.bodySite.extension","path":"Condition.bodySite.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Condition.bodySite.extension:Laterality","path":"Condition.bodySite.extension","sliceName":"Laterality","max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/BodySite-Qualifier"}]},{"id":"Condition.bodySite.extension:Laterality.valueCodeableConcept:valueCodeableConcept","path":"Condition.bodySite.extension.valueCodeableConcept","sliceName":"valueCodeableConcept","short":"Laterality","definition":"Laterality adds information about body side to the anatomic location, e.g. left","alias":["Lateraliteit"],"binding":{"strength":"required","description":"BrandwondLateraliteitCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.19.4.4--20171231000000"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.10","comment":"Laterality"}]},{"id":"Condition.subject","path":"Condition.subject","type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-patient"}]},{"id":"Condition.onset[x]","path":"Condition.onset[x]","short":"DateOfOnset","definition":"Date on which the burn wound appeared.","alias":["OntstaansDatum"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.3","comment":"DateOfOnset"}]},{"id":"Condition.stage","path":"Condition.stage","min":1},{"id":"Condition.stage.summary","path":"Condition.stage.summary","short":"Depth","definition":"Description of the severity of the burn wound, ranging from degree 1 - 3.","alias":["Dieptegraad"],"min":1,"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"DieptegraadCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.19.4.1--20171231000000","display":"DieptegraadCodelijst"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.2","comment":"Depth"}]},{"id":"Condition.note","path":"Condition.note","short":"Comment","definition":"Comment on the burn wound.","alias":["Toelichting"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-burnwound-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.4.5","comment":"Comment"}]}]}}
