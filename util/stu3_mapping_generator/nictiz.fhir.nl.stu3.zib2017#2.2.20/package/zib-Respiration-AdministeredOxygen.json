Observations of spontaneous breathing, usually registered as part of the observation of vital functions.","purpose":"# Purpose of HCIM\r\nObserving a person’s spontaneous breathing, including recording breathing frequency, depth and rhythm, is done to gain an indication of the health condition of the patient’s pulmonary system.\r\n\r\n# Purpose of this profile\r\nThis profile extends the zib-Respiration resource with info about administered oxygen. It is complemented by the profiles zib-Respiration-AdministeredOxygen-AdministrationDevice (DeviceUseStatement) and zib-Respiration-AdministeredOxygen-AdministrationDeviceProduct (Device) to register the device used to administer extra oxygen.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-respiration-v3.1-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Respiration-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM Respiration-v3.1(2017EN)"}],"kind":"complex-type","abstract":false,"contextType":"resource","context":["Observation"],"type":"Extension","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Extension","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Extension.extension","path":"Extension.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Extension.extension:extraOxygenAdministration","path":"Extension.extension","sliceName":"extraOxygenAdministration","max":"1"},{"id":"Extension.extension:extraOxygenAdministration.url","path":"Extension.extension.url","fixedUri":"extraOxygenAdministration"},{"id":"Extension.extension:extraOxygenAdministration.value[x]:valueBoolean","path":"Extension.extension.valueBoolean","sliceName":"valueBoolean","type":[{"code":"boolean"}]},{"id":"Extension.extension:flowRate","path":"Extension.extension","sliceName":"flowRate","max":"1"},{"id":"Extension.extension:flowRate.url","path":"Extension.extension.url","fixedUri":"flowRate"},{"id":"Extension.extension:flowRate.value[x]:valueQuantity","path":"Extension.extension.valueQuantity","sliceName":"valueQuantity","type":[{"code":"Quantity"}]},{"id":"Extension.extension:fiO2","path":"Extension.extension","sliceName":"fiO2","max":"1"},{"id":"Extension.extension:fiO2.url","path":"Extension.extension.url","fixedUri":"fiO2"},{"id":"Extension.extension:fiO2.value[x]:valueQuantity","path":"Extension.extension.valueQuantity","sliceName":"valueQuantity","type":[{"code":"Quantity"}]},{"id":"Extension.value[x]","path":"Extension.value[x]","max":"0"}]}}
