For wound tissue (T in the TIME model), the structure of the WCS model (Woundcare Consultant Society, WCS Kenniscentrum Wondzorg) is used. The WCS model is not suited for describing oncological ulcers. There is a separate classification for that. \r\nOncological ulcers are skin defects which result from the tumor process. They are different from wounds resulting from cancer treatment, such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy or surgery. \r\n \r\nThe concept does not describe decubitus wounds and burn wounds. For these, the relevant information models can be used.","purpose":"Information on the wound is recorded to share this information with other health professionals. This information can be used to monitor the wound’s healing process and provide insight into the implemented policy. In a transfer situation, it facilitates continuation of the treatment.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-wound-v3.1-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Wound-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM Wound-v3.1(2017EN)"},{"identity":"hcim-basicelements-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM BasicElements-v1.0(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Condition","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Condition","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Condition","path":"Condition","short":"Wound","comment":"The individual component observations for this HCIM are captured using the [WoundCharacteristics profile](http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/WoundCharacteristics).","alias":["Wond"]},{"id":"Condition.extension","path":"Condition.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Condition.extension:DateOfLastDressingChange","path":"Condition.extension","sliceName":"DateOfLastDressingChange","max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/condition-dateOfLastDressingChange"}]},{"id":"Condition.extension:DateOfLastDressingChange.valueDateTime:valueDateTime","path":"Condition.extension.valueDateTime","sliceName":"valueDateTime","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-wound-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.2.3","comment":"DateOfLastDressingChange"}]},{"id":"Condition.code","path":"Condition.code","short":"WoundType","definition":"Description of the type of wound.","alias":["WondSoort"],"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"WondSoortCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.19.2.4--20171231000000","display":"WondSoortCodelijst"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-wound-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.2.5","comment":"WoundType"}]},{"id":"Condition.code.coding","path":"Condition.code.coding","min":1},{"id":"Condition.code.coding.system","path":"Condition.code.coding.system","min":1},{"id":"Condition.code.coding.code","path":"Condition.code.coding.code","min":1},{"id":"Condition.bodySite","path":"Condition.bodySite","short":"AnatomicalLocation","alias":["AnatomischeLocatie"],"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"WondAnatomischeLocatieCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.19.2.6--20171231000000","display":"WondAnatomischeLocatieCodelijst"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-wound-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.2.8","comment":"AnatomicalLocation"}]},{"id":"Condition.bodySite.extension","path":"Condition.bodySite.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Condition.bodySite.extension:Laterality","path":"Condition.bodySite.extension","sliceName":"Laterality","max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/BodySite-Qualifier"}]},{"id":"Condition.bodySite.extension:Laterality.valueCodeableConcept:valueCodeableConcept","path":"Condition.bodySite.extension.valueCodeableConcept","sliceName":"valueCodeableConcept","short":"Laterality","definition":"Laterality adds information about body side to the anatomic location, e.g. left","alias":["Lateraliteit"],"binding":{"strength":"required","description":"WondLateraliteitCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.19.2.8--20171231000000"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-wound-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.2.18","comment":"Laterality"}]},{"id":"Condition.subject","path":"Condition.subject","type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-patient"}],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-basicelements-v1.0-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:0.0.11","comment":"Subject"}]},{"id":"Condition.onset[x]","path":"Condition.onset[x]","short":"WoundDateOfOnset","definition":"The date on which the wound appeared.","alias":["WondOntstaansDatum"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-wound-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.2.2","comment":"WoundDateOfOnset"}]},{"id":"Condition.note","path":"Condition.note","definition":"Comment on the wound."},{"id":"Condition.note.text","path":"Condition.note.text","short":"Comment","definition":"Comment on the wound.","alias":["Toelichting"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-wound-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:19.2.9","comment":"Comment"}]}]}}
