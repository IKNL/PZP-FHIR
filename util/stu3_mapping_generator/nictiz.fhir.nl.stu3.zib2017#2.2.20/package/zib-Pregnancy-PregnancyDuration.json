A pregnancy of between 37 and 42 weeks is considered normal. 'Term pregnancy' is 37 to 42 weeks. The term gravidity is also used for the number of times a woman has been pregnant. This and parity - the number of times a woman has given birth - provides insight into the patient’s obstetric history.","purpose":"# Purpose of HCIM\r\nIf the patient is pregnant, it is important to mention this, as it requires specific attention in their care. Pregnancy can influence treatment decisions, the treatment itself and the patient’s care.\r\n\r\n# Purpose of this profile\r\nThis profile implements the PregnancyDurationfield of the HCIM, which can be used to record the duration of the pregnancy at a specific moment in time. It complements the zib-Pregnancy profile, which tracks the overarching condition. This profile can be referenced with the Observation.zib-Pregnancy field (event-partOf extension).","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-pregnancy-v3.1-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Pregnancy-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM Pregnancy-v3.1(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Observation","baseDefinition":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-observation","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Observation.extension","path":"Observation.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Observation.extension:zib-Pregnancy","path":"Observation.extension","sliceName":"zib-Pregnancy","max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/observation-focusSTU3"}]},{"id":"Observation.extension:zib-Pregnancy.valueReference:valueReference","path":"Observation.extension.valueReference","sliceName":"valueReference","type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-Pregnancy"}]},{"id":"Observation.code.coding","path":"Observation.code.coding","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"code"}],"rules":"open"},"min":1},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:FetalGestationalAge","path":"Observation.code.coding","sliceName":"FetalGestationalAge","min":1,"max":"1"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:FetalGestationalAge.system","path":"Observation.code.coding.system","min":1,"fixedUri":"http://snomed.info/sct"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:FetalGestationalAge.code","path":"Observation.code.coding.code","min":1,"fixedCode":"57036006"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:FetalGestationalAge.display","extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-translatable","valueBoolean":true}],"path":"Observation.code.coding.display","defaultValueString":"Fetal gestational age"},{"id":"Observation.effective[x]:effectiveDateTime","path":"Observation.effectiveDateTime","sliceName":"effectiveDateTime","min":1,"type":[{"code":"dateTime"}]},{"id":"Observation.value[x]:valueQuantity","path":"Observation.value[x]","sliceName":"valueQuantity","short":"PregnancyDuration","definition":"Duration of the pregnancy on the day on which the patient was asked.
