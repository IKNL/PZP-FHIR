A pregnancy of between 37 and 42 weeks is considered normal. 'Term pregnancy' is 37 to 42 weeks. The term gravidity is also used for the number of times a woman has been pregnant. This and parity - the number of times a woman has given birth - provides insight into the patient’s obstetric history.","purpose":"# Purpose of HCIM\r\nIf the patient is pregnant, it is important to mention this, as it requires specific attention in their care.
