Adults and older children may carry out nursing interventions by themselves. Therefore skills training is needed for caregivers/ children. Qualification is required for correct performing of an intervention and also knowledge about what to do in case of complications.\r\nThe assessment of the degree to which the intervention can be performed independently refers only to the indicated intervention.","purpose":"This profile specifies to what degree a patient is able to perform a specific nursing activity. The activity itself is described in detail using a zib-NursingIntervention profile. The current profile is much simpler and makes on observation on the abilities of the patient in regards to it.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytoperformnursingactivities-v1.0-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/AbilityToPerformNursingActivities-v1.0(2017EN)","name":"HCIM AbilityToPerformNursingActivities-v1.0(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Observation","baseDefinition":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-observation","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Observation","path":"Observation","alias":["VermogenTotVerpleegtechnischeHandelingen"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytoperformnursingactivities-v1.0-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:4.34.1","comment":"AbilityToPerformNursingActivities"}]},{"id":"Observation.extension","path":"Observation.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Observation.extension:nursingIntervention","path":"Observation.extension","sliceName":"nursingIntervention","min":1,"max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/observation-zibNursingInterventionReference"}]},{"id":"Observation.extension:nursingIntervention.valueReference:valueReference","path":"Observation.extension.valueReference","sliceName":"valueReference","short":"NursingIntervention","definition":"Specification of nursing interventions where the skills relate to.","alias":["VerpleegkundigeInterventie"],"min":1,"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytoperformnursingactivities-v1.0-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:4.34.3","comment":"NursingIntervention"}]},{"id":"Observation.extension:focus","path":"Observation.extension","sliceName":"focus","max":"1","type":[{"code":"Extension","profile":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/observation-focusSTU3"}]},{"id":"Observation.extension:focus.valueReference:valueReference","path":"Observation.extension.valueReference","sliceName":"valueReference","alias":["Betrokkene"],"type":[{"code":"Reference","targetProfile":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-relatedperson"}]},{"id":"Observation.code.coding","path":"Observation.code.coding","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"code"}],"rules":"open"},"min":1},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToPerformNursingActivities","path":"Observation.code.coding","sliceName":"AbilityToPerformNursingActivities","min":1,"max":"1"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToPerformNursingActivities.system","path":"Observation.code.coding.system","min":1,"fixedUri":"http://snomed.info/sct"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToPerformNursingActivities.code","path":"Observation.code.coding.code","min":1,"fixedCode":"303074009"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:AbilityToPerformNursingActivities.display","extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-translatable","valueBoolean":true}],"path":"Observation.code.coding.display","defaultValueString":"Ability to manage personal health care"},{"id":"Observation.value[x]:valueCodeableConcept","path":"Observation.valueCodeableConcept","sliceName":"valueCodeableConcept","alias":["VerrichtenVPKHandeling"],"min":1,"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"VerrichtenVPKHandelingCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.4.34.1--20171231000000","display":"VerrichtenVPKHandelingCodelijst"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytoperformnursingactivities-v1.0-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:4.34.2","comment":"PerformNursingActivity"}]}]}}
