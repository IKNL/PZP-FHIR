The infusion has a number of components.\r\n\r\nThe infusion contains: \r\n\r\n* the (peripheral) cannula or the (central) catheter put into the patient peripherally or centrally;\r\n* the administering system connected to the cannula/catheter allowing the administered fluid to run,\r\n* the infusion bag containing the fluid.\r\n\r\nMultiple administering systems may be connected to one cannula/catheter. Furthermore, a central venous catheter may have multiple lumens. \r\n\r\nArterial and epidural catheters also exist in addition to venous catheters.","purpose":"The purpose of an infusion is usually to administer fluid and/or medication. \r\nInformation on present infusions is recorded to inform other health professionals. This information is of importance in determining the care required for the patient and in safely administering medication. In a transfer situation, the information offers the option to realize continuity of care by organizing specific expertise and materials in advance, for example.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-infusion-v3.2-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/Infusion-v3.2(2017EN)","name":"HCIM Infusion-v3.2(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"DeviceUseStatement","baseDefinition":"http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-MedicalDevice","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"DeviceUseStatement","path":"DeviceUseStatement","short":"Infusion","alias":["Infuus"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-infusion-v3.2-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:10.2.1","comment":"Infusion"}]},{"id":"DeviceUseStatement.extension","path":"DeviceUseStatement.extension","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"url"}],"rules":"open"},"min":1},{"id":"DeviceUseStatement.extension:LumenOrLine","path":"DeviceUseStatement.extension","sliceName":"LumenOrLine","definition":"Container of the LumenOrLine concept.
