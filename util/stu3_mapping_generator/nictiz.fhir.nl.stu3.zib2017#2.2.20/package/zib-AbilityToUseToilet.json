Limitations in this ability indicate a reduced ability to cope for oneself.\r\nThis activity and activities such as those including eating, getting dressed and bathing are also known as activities of daily living (ADL). These are the activities people go through in daily life. The extent to which a person is able to do all these activities by themselves is a measure for their total ability to do things independently.","purpose":"# Purpose of HCIM\r\nInformation on limitations in a patient’s ability to urinate, defecate and keep up their hygiene during their menstrual cycle is important in determining the nature and intensity of the care the patient needs. In a transfer situation, it gives the receiving organization the ability to anticipate the intensity of the care to be given to the patient, enabling continuity in healthcare for the patient.\r\nIf policy has been implemented to improve a patient’s ability to do things independently, the entered extent of independence helps to determine the efficiency of the treatment.\r\n\r\n# Purpose of this profile\r\nThis profile is part of a group of statements regarding the patients ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Each statement applies to the current situation and is modeled as an observation regarding one aspect of these abilities.\r\nAlthough the FHIR ClinicalImpression resource is a better fit than the Observation resource for these kinds of records, ClinicalImpression is still highly experimental at the time of writing and doesn't map very well to the HCIM. Therefore, the more mature Observation resource is chosen.","copyright":"CC0","fhirVersion":"3.0.2","mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytousetoilet-v3.1-2017EN","uri":"https://zibs.nl/wiki/AbilityToUseToilet-v3.1(2017EN)","name":"HCIM AbilityToUseToilet-v3.1(2017EN)"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"Observation","baseDefinition":"http://fhir.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/nl-core-observation","derivation":"constraint","differential":{"element":[{"id":"Observation","path":"Observation","alias":["VermogenTotToiletgang"],"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytousetoilet-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:4.22.1","comment":"ToiletUseAbility"}]},{"id":"Observation.code.coding","path":"Observation.code.coding","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"value","path":"code"}],"rules":"open"},"min":1},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:ToiletUseAbility","path":"Observation.code.coding","sliceName":"ToiletUseAbility","min":1,"max":"1"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:ToiletUseAbility.system","path":"Observation.code.coding.system","min":1,"fixedUri":"http://snomed.info/sct"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:ToiletUseAbility.code","path":"Observation.code.coding.code","min":1,"fixedCode":"284779002"},{"id":"Observation.code.coding:ToiletUseAbility.display","extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-translatable","valueBoolean":true}],"path":"Observation.code.coding.display","defaultValueString":"Ability to perform personal hygiene activity"},{"id":"Observation.component","path":"Observation.component","slicing":{"discriminator":[{"type":"pattern","path":"code"}],"rules":"open"}},{"id":"Observation.component:ToiletUse","path":"Observation.component","sliceName":"ToiletUse","max":"1"},{"id":"Observation.component:ToiletUse.code","path":"Observation.component.code","patternCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"system":"http://snomed.info/sct","code":"284899001"}]}},{"id":"Observation.component:ToiletUse.value[x]:valueCodeableConcept","path":"Observation.component.valueCodeableConcept","sliceName":"valueCodeableConcept","short":"ToiletUse","definition":"Coordinating and realizing urination or defecation, such as indicating the need, getting into the right position, finding and reaching a suitable spot, manipulating clothing before and after urination, and cleaning up (the body) afterwards.","alias":["Toiletgebruik"],"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"ToiletgebruikCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.4.22.4--20171231000000"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytousetoilet-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:4.22.6","comment":"ToiletUse"}]},{"id":"Observation.component:MenstrualCare","path":"Observation.component","sliceName":"MenstrualCare","max":"1"},{"id":"Observation.component:MenstrualCare.code","path":"Observation.component.code","patternCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"system":"http://snomed.info/sct","code":"284955009"}]}},{"id":"Observation.component:MenstrualCare.value[x]:valueCodeableConcept","path":"Observation.component.valueCodeableConcept","sliceName":"valueCodeableConcept","short":"MenstrualCare","definition":"Coordinating, planning and hygiene in the event of menstruation, such as anticipating the menstruation and using sanitary napkins and tampons.","alias":["ZorgBijMenstruatie"],"type":[{"code":"CodeableConcept"}],"binding":{"strength":"extensible","description":"ZorgBijMenstruatieCodelijst","valueSetReference":{"reference":"http://decor.nictiz.nl/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.2.4.3.11.60.40.2.4.22.3--20171231000000"}},"mapping":[{"identity":"hcim-abilitytousetoilet-v3.1-2017EN","map":"NL-CM:4.22.4","comment":"MenstrualCare"}]}]}}
