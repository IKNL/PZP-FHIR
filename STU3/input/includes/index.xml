<h3>Project Description and Scope</h3>
  <p>
    This Implementation Guide (IG) supports the Advanced Care Planning (ACP) information standard 
    (Dutch: Palliatieve Zorg Planning) and is intended for use within the palliative care domain 
    in the Netherlands. This domain involves care for patients with an incurable illness or 
    condition from which they are expected to die.

  <p>
    Developed by the <a href="https://iknl.nl/en">Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation</a> (Dutch: Integraal kankercentrum Nederland (IKNL)), 
    this guide provides technical direction for using FHIR to exchange ACP data.     It is based on <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/index.html">HL7 FHIR STU3</a> 
    and builds on top of the <a href="https://simplifier.net/packages/nictiz.fhir.nl.stu3.zib2017">Dutch Core STU3 profiles</a>. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This guide assumes that readers are familiar with the functional specifications of ACP and 
    the STU3 version of FHIR. For more background information and access to the functional 
    specifications, please refer to the <a href="https://example.com">following link</a>.
