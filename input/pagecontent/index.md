### Project Description and Scope
This Implementation Guide (IG) supports the Advance Care Planning (ACP) information standard (Dutch: Palliatieve Zorg Planning) and is intended for use within the palliative care domain in the Netherlands. This domain involves care for patients with an incurable illness or condition from which they are expected to die.

Developed by the <a href="https://iknl.nl/en">Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organisation</a> (Dutch: Integraal kankercentrum Nederland (IKNL)), this guide provides technical direction for using FHIR to exchange ACP data. It is based on <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html">HL7 FHIR R4</a> and builds on top of the <a href="https://simplifier.net/packages/nictiz.fhir.nl.r4.nl-core">Dutch Core R4 profiles</a>. 

This guide assumes that readers are familiar with the functional specifications of ACP and the R4 version of FHIR. For more background information and access to the functional specifications, please refer to the <a href="functioneel-ontwerp.html">following link</a>.
